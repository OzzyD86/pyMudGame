# pyMudGame
A MUD game engine written in Python

Based on a lockdown project called MUDDle, this is the conversion project from PHP

Currently  in four parts:

*  Mud test engine
* Game Engine
*  Phrase replace
* something else

## Caveat

Please note that some of the code is quite messy and uses imports weirdly and calls in ways that look suspicious for sake of ease. I'm looking for alternative workable methods and am open to suggestions as opposed to mere shoutdowns. Thanks :)
